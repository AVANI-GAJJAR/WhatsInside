		<h1 id="i1">What is Yoga?</h1>
	<p>
		If you thought that yoga was all about bending and twisting your body in odd shapes, it's time to rethink. Yoga is much more. In very simple words, giving care to your body, mind and breath is yoga.

		Derived from the Sankrit word ‘yuj’ which means ‘to unite or integrate’, yoga is a 5,000-year-old Indian body of knowledge. Yoga is all about harmonizing the body with the mind and breath through the means of various breathing exercises, yoga poses (asanas) and meditation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Yoga is a spiritual discipline dating back to some 5000 years in the history of Indian philosophy, its purpose, mainly to unleash spiritual and mental powers of an individual. However, in recent times yoga has been extremely popular in the context of fighting stress, anxiety and depression in these times of industrialization and our super-fast lifestyles.

		"Apart from the spiritual aspects, the physiological benefits acquired from yoga have recently had radical scientific understandings behind its workings. It is also moderatea the surge and the production of chemicals in the body that affect us mentally, physically as well as psychosomatically. So, let's understand the science behind yoga that makes it so useful!"

	<h1>BENIFITS OF YOGA</h1> 
	<hr align="left" width="40%">
	<dl>
		<dt>Moderates Stress Hormones</dt>
		<dd>When our body gets severely stressed, it secretes a hormone called cortisol which keeps us alert in crisis situations, but also disturbs the body functioning in the long term. Yoga reduces the stress level of a person, thus moderating the production of the cortisol hormone and keeping the individual calm.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Secretes Antioxidant Enzymes</dt>
		<dd>Repeated exposure to environmental pollutants and metabolic by-products result in the formation of free radicals, which contribute to many diseases including cancer and expedite the aging process. To counteract free radicals, the human body has a powerful internal defense system in the form of antioxidant enzymes. The levels of antioxidant enzymes were found to be significantly higher in people practicing yoga, thus enhancing the defense against free radical damage.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Stimulates Parasympathetic Nervous System</dt>
		<dd>Yoga actually stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms us down and restores balance after a major stress is over. When the parasympathetic nervous system switches on, blood is directed toward endocrine glands, digestive organs, and other organs, thus reducing the heartbeat rate and lowering the blood pressure.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Improves Immunity Function</dt>
		<dd>This is attributed to the fact that yoga reduces cortisol hormone. Too much of cortisol can dampen the effectiveness of the immune system by immobilizing our defense system in the body (WBC). Yoga moderates the production of cortisol, thus boosting immunity.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Cures Addiction</dt>
		<dd>Dopamine, a chemical in the brain that gives one contentment during a high on ones drug of choice is generated naturally by doing yoga. Thus, the craving for that level of contentment from addiction is no longer manifested. Yoga can give one the same level of dopamine high or contentment, thus cutting out the craving of addiction.</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Helps Stay in the Present</dt>
		<dd>Yoga makes one attentive to the present moment and gives more awareness towards negative thoughts and the ability to let go of them for the sake of self-preservation.</dd>

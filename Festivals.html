		Every festival in Hindu Culture has hidden reasons and scientific logics behind the festivals we celebrate. One of the biggest Hindu festival diwali we celebrated has a hidden science and logic. <i>Lets have a look...</i><br>

		Diwali or what we often term it as the festival of light falls in October or November, and the festival is celebrated with much grandeur in north India s compared to the southern parts of India. October/November is a very weird season, especially if you look at the climate pattern. <i>Its metamorphism from raining to humid and getting chilled at night exposes you to various kinds of virus and diseases, the most popular being the common cold.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is because this perfect weather which is promoted by the low temperature and humid, the bacteria starts propagating. An ignited oil lamp, together with the chemicals evolved from <i>the flame kills these bacterial populations.</i> The effect gets multiplied to several thousand times when you light up hundreds of diyas around you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another interesting thing to note is that the light of the Diya superposes over the <i>magnetic field around your superficial electromagnetic flux. The phenomenon activated your blood cells and the immunity provided by them makes you feel so energetic and full of life.</i> That is why during Diwali homes are cleaned and hundreds of lamps are lit to ensure the atmosphere around is all safe.

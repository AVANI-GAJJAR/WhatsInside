			WORKSHIP, SPIRITUALITY AND SCIENCE
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>One of the most famous scientific conversations consists of a two-line exchange between <b>Albert Einstein</b> and <b>Niels Bohr.</b>  Averse to the randomness of quantum mechanics, Einstein brushed it aside with a dismissive,<em><u> “God doesn’t play dice with the universe.”</em></u> To which his friend and colleague, Bohr, replied,<em><u>“Please stop telling God what to do.”</em></u>
	</p>
	<p>
	That two of the greatest scientists should cite God as an arbiter in a scientific dispute shouldn’t cause any surprise to those who see no innate contradiction between the spirit of religion and that of science.</p>
	<h1>Ideal Workship</h1>
	<p>

		The deity could be sitting, standing or lying down. the hand mudras are also given due importance.Basically the temples are made using certain scientific principles so that they become conducive for doing particular sadhana or worship.
	</p>
	<P>
		 In hindus temples, marble is used extensively because marble has a unique property that it absorbs the vibrations for thousands of years. So it becomes very charged with spiritual energy and helps all the sadhaks.The inner grabha is the powerhouse of the energy. so the size, location and height of grabha graha is mathematically calculated.<br>
		 Special stone are used for making idols. Not all stones can be used to prepare idols. Certain rocks or stones are selected. stones of some places are well known for making idols.

	<h1>Why Temples Are Built?</h1>

	<p>
		There are thousands of temples all over India in different size, shape and locations but not all of them are considered to be built the Vedic way. It is said that in the ancient times, a temple should be located at a place where earth's magnetic wave path passes through densely. How the energy quotient of a place was measured is not known but keeping in mind the lost advance science fundas of our ancient saints, they would have figured a way out!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The Five senses of the body get activated when you are inside the temple if the positive energy inside the temple is absorbed properly that is only if you ensure that all the five senses are activated in your body while in the temple. The senses of the Human Body are Sight, Hearing, Taste, Sight, And Smell.
	</p>
	<h1>Bells In Temple</h1>

	<p>
		A Temple bell is another scientific phenomena; it is not just your ordinary metal. It is made of various metals including cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, chromium and. manganese. The proportion at which each one of them mixed is real science behind a bell. Each of these bells is made to produce such a distinct sound that it can create unity of your left and right brain.
	</p>
	<p>
		The moment you ring that bell, bell produces sharp but lasting sound which lasts for minimum of seven seconds in echo mode good enough to touch your seven healing centers or chakras in your body. The moment bell sound happens your brain is emptied of all thoughts. Invariably you will enter state of Tran’s state where you are very receptive. This Trans state is the one with awareness.

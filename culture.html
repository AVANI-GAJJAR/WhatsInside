		<p>
			In Indian culture, people greet each other by joining their palms – termed as “Namaskar.” The general reason behind this tradition is that greeting by joining both the palms means respect. However, scientifically speaking, joining both hands ensures joining the tips of all the fingers together; which are denoted to the pressure points of eyes, ears, and mind. Pressing them together is said to activate the pressure points which helps us remember that person for a long time.

		<p>
			On the forehead, between the two eyebrows, is a spot that is considered as a major nerve point in human body. The Tilak is believed to prevent the loss of “energy”, the red ‘Kumkum’ between the eyebrows is said to retain energy in the human body and control the various levels of concentration. While applying Kumkum the points on the mid-brow region and Adnya-chakra is automatically pressed. This also facilitates the blood supply to the face muscles.

			Wearing toe rings is not just the significance of married women but there is scientific reason behind it. Normally toe rings are worn on the second toe. A particular nerve from the second toe connects the uterus and passes to heart. Wearing toe ring on this finger strengthens the uterus. It will keep menstrual cycle regularized. As silver is a good conductor, it also absorbs polar energies from the earth and passes it to the body.

		<p>
			The scientific reason behind fasting is found in Ayurveda.This ancient Indian medical system points out correctly that the basic cause of many diseases is the accumulation of toxic materials in the digestive system. Regular cleansing of toxic materials keeps one healthy. By fasting, the digestive organs get rest and all body mechanisms are cleansed and corrected. A complete fast is good for heath and  occasional intake of warm lemon juice during the period of fasting prevents the flatulence.

		<li><h1>Not Cutting Nails At Night</h1></li>
		<img src="cut.jpg">
		<p>
			In old times there was no provision of 24-hour electricity at homes like we have today. Also, there was no nail cutter at that time! People used the sharp edges of tools like scissors or knife to cut nails. Therefore, cutting nails using them in dark could very well cut your finger! Therefore the habit of cutting nails at night was discouraged.
